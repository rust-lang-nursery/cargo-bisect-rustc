# Changelog

## v0.5.3

### Added

- Support specifying the path to a rust-lang/rust clone at runtime with `RUST_SRC_REPO`

### Changed

- Make `--with-cargo` the default to allow bisecting past changes in rustc options. Add `--without-cargo` flag to use the old behavior.
- Use an anonymous remote that always points to rust-lang/rust when refreshing repository

### Fixed

- Add nightly start and end date validations against the current date â€“ previously would attempt to install nightly even if date was in the future
- Verify that `--test-dir` is a directory instead of assuming it is and then panicking
